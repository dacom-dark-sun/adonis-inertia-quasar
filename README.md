# ADONIS-INERTIA-QUASAR Starter Kit

A monolithic starter kit for rapid full-stack development, where the SPA frontend is seamlessly managed by a powerful backend. Each page can receive parameters from the backend during rendering, eliminating the need to build extensive APIs for most interactions. Quasar provides a robust set of pre-built solutions for creating powerful interfaces out of the box. Templates are written in PUG, which helps eliminate unnecessary HTML clutter and improves code readability.
